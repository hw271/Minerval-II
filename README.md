[Minerval II](http://141.161.20.98/direwolf/index.php?r=counterfeit) is a domain specific search engine project for [Memex - Darpa](http://www.darpa.mil/program/memex). It serves to help the government collect evidence of counterfeit sale. This repository is the pattern analysis part of Minerval II. It utilizes [Stanford Natural Language Process](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/) tool (**_Stanford NLP_**) to analyze the evidence provided by users, extracing **_semantic pattern_** from the evidence and conducting a second search to discover more evidence.
